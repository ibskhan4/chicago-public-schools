# Chicago Public Schools Project

## Logistics

Within the "graph" folder, you will find my app.R and my .rmd files which I
used to create plots before finalizing them in my app.R file. All of my
csv files which contain the data I used and manipulated are in the data
folder.

## Background

This project covers the interplay between funding deficits and school closures,
also covering metrics such as enrollment and dropout rates. The various
sections of the shiny app go into a lot more detail. 

## About Me

My name is Ibraheem Khan, and I'm a sophomore studying Applied Mathematics and
Economics. Perhaps one of my greatest insights came from the sheer difficulty to
research find data for this project. Despite being one of the largest districts
in the nation, there was a paucity of workable data to begin with, and even with 
some data sources, they couldn't be exported or used. One of the goals for my
project was to visualize and bring to light these issues to make them more
accessible.
